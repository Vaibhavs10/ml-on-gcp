    "This notebook demonstrates how to use AI Platform to train a simple classification model using `scikit-learn`, and then deploy the model to get predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You train the model to predict a person's income level based on the [Census Income data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you jump in, let’s cover some of the different tools you’ll be using:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ [AI Platform](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/) is a managed service that enables you to easily build machine learning models that work on any type of data, of any size.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ [Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) is a unified object storage for developers and enterprises, from live data serving to data analytics/ML to data archiving.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ [Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) is a command line tool which allows you to interact with Google Cloud products. This notebook introduces several `gcloud` and `gsutil` commands, which are part of the Cloud SDK. Note that shell commands in a notebook must be prepended with a `!`."
